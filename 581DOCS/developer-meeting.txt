## Design & Discussion
* Discussion on where animation controls could go, separate from current Timeline header. In other editor headers or new footers perhaps. But not in a full-width status bar. Needs more thought.
* The use of the Blender logo icon in Preferences / Add-ons looks incorrect.
* Pablo has a PR to add quick access to add-on folder. #128474
* Conference
   * We'll do something like a "Blender This Year", mostly highlighting what we've done over the past year (4.0 to present).
* Some discussion of Expose lock_rotation in the view menu #122185 and Pablo approves.
* UI Experiment: Operator Preferences on Status Bar #126477 10
   * Now a more useful demonstration, even doing more than we'd want.
   * We still like the idea. Julian not liking the inconsistency that the extra items are preferences that change for next invocation. Will try separating these from the rest with a vertical rule and "Preferences: "
* WIP: UI: Use SVG Icons for Tools #125378 2
   * Campbell wants design changes, will bring up in Core meetings
* WIP: UI: Bidirectional Text and Complex Shaping #104662 2
   * Working okay, minimally invasive, but would require RTL dev support
   * Not discussed
* WIP: UI: Icons in ID Search List (Alt) #127086 1
   * We discussed ways of doing this without passing *ID, but still allowing the user count.
* WIP: UI: SVG Icons as Mouse Cursors #127326
   * working now as a proof of concept, rendering 1 & 32 bpp
   * Harley's won't spend much time on this, but next step is adding more icons and removing the default cursor as the test one shown.
* WIP: UI: Preferences Search #119072 7
   * Hans made many changes
   * Not discussed much as Hans is away.
